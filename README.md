# Appio

Python ASGI framework for building APIs 

_As for now it's in very early stage of development_

It's core/unique features are(will be):
- Builtin validation and documentation engine. 
- Routes are formed in groups. Group can include another groups and routes. So it is perfect for scaling and versioning.
- Middleware functions can be mounted not on the app, but on any group or route. So it adds flexibility to web app architecture.
